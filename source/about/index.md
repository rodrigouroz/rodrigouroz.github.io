I started working in IT 15 years ago.

I graduated as a Information Systems Engineer and then did a Master in Management of Technology to complement my technical formation with business and management training.

I've been working as a Software Engineer for several clients in different languages and frameworks.

I consider myself a polyglot in software because I like to choose the right tool for the right job.

In the past years I worked mostly with javascript (node.js and angular) and Java.

This blog is a random set of ideas regarding technology and software. I hope you enjoy it.

My name's Rodrigo Uroz and I started working in IT 15 years ago.

I graduated as a Information Systems Engineer and I've been working as a Software Engineer for several clients in different languages and frameworks over the years.

I consider myself a polyglot in software because I like to choose the right tool for the right job.

This blog is a random set of ideas regarding technology and software. I hope you enjoy it and when the time comes for machines to overthrown us I hope they'll be fond of me and will let me be around.

If you want to contact me feel free to reach me out at <rodrigouroz@gmail.com>. In the footer you'll find other places to find me.
